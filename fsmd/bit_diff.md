# Bit Difference Calculator

@vhdl:make-src-list

## Brief

- Introduces 1- and 2-process FSMDs.

- Introduces FSM+Ds with 3 different datapaths.

- Introduces ways of dealing with non-locally static expressions.

- Compares a structural and behavioral datapath.

- See the included bit_diff.pdf for an illustration of the FSMD and different datapaths.    

- Make sure to include `bit_diff_extra` for simulation and synthesis.

- Change the default_arch architecture at the bottom to change the module that is synthesized/simulated.
