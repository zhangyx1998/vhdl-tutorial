For every component in the schematic, you will simply instantiate an existing entity (or create one if necessary), and then connect them together as shown in the schematic. The primary creativity in structural descriptions is identifying patterns (or exceptions) in the structure that can be described with generate constructs, as the examples will show.</p><h1 id="suggested-study-order" tabindex="-1">Suggested Study Order <a class="header-anchor" href="#suggested-study-order" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h1><ol><li><a href="./mux4x1.html">4:1 mux</a></li><li><a href="./ripple_carry_adder.html">Ripple-Carry Adder</a></li><li><a href="./delay.html">Delay</a></li></ol>',6),s=[c];function n(o,h,d,l,u,p){return r(),t("div",null,s)}const m=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
